# Live-Weather-Forecasting-Application
Developed a Live Weather Forecasting Android Application using Android Studio and Java. This app intiates API calls using the openweathermap API to receive weather information about whatever location the user inputs.
This app considers the current temperature, max temperature, min temperature, humidity, weather state, cloudiness and coordinates of the location among other things.
The weather information is converted into Fahrenheit by default, however, the user can activate a switch which converts it to Celsius instead if preferred.
